## 🗄️ Database Design

The project uses a **normalized relational schema** in CockroachDB:

### Tables Used
- `aggregated_transaction`
- `aggregated_insurance`
- `aggregated_user`
- `map_transaction`
- `map_insurance`
- `map_user`
- `top_transaction`
- `top_insurance`
- `top_user`

Each table supports:
- `states`
- `years`
- `quarter`
- Metric-specific columns (amounts, counts, users, etc.)

## 🔐 Secure Database Connection

Database credentials are **NOT hardcoded**.  
They are securely managed using **Streamlit Secrets**.
